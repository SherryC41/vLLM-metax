## About

vLLM MetaX is a hardware plugin for running vLLM seamlessly on MetaX GPU, which is a cuda_alike backend and provided near-native CUDA experiences on MetaX Hardware with [*MACA*](https://www.metax-tech.com/en/goods/platform.html?cid=4).

It is the recommended approach for supporting the MetaX backend within the vLLM community. 

The plugin follows the vLLM plugin RFCs by default:
 - [[RFC]: Hardware pluggable](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/11162)
 - [[RFC]: Enhancing vLLM Plugin Architecture](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/19161)

Which ensured the hardware features and functionality support on integration of the MetaX GPU with vLLM.

## Prerequisites

- Hardware: MetaX C-series
- OS: Linux
- Software:
  - Python >= 3.9, < 3.12
  - vLLM (the same version as vllm-metax)
  - Docker support

## Getting Started

vLLM MetaX currently only support starting on docker images release by [MetaX develop community](https://developer.metax-tech.com/softnova/docker?chip_name=%E6%9B%A6%E4%BA%91C500%E7%B3%BB%E5%88%97&package_kind=AI&dimension=docker&deliver_type=%E5%88%86%E5%B1%82%E5%8C%85&ai_frame=vllm-metax) which is out of box. (DockerFile for other OS is undertesting)

If you want to develop, debug or test the newest feature on vllm-metax, you may need to build from scratch and follow this [*source build tutorial*](https://vllm-metax.readthedocs.io/en/v0.13.0/getting_started/installation/maca.html). 

## Branch

vllm-metax has three kind of branches.

- **master**: main branch，catching up with main branch of vLLM upstream.
- **releases/vX.Y.Z**: release branch, created when a new version of vLLM is released. For example, `releases/v0.1x.0` is the release branch for vLLM `v0.1x.0` version. (Same tag name)
- **vX.Y.Z-dev**: development branch, created with part of new releases of vLLM. For example, `v0.1x.0-dev` is the dev branch for vLLM `v0.1x.0` version.

Below is the maintained branches:

| Branch      | Status       | Note                                 |
